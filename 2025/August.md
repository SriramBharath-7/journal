- I had a special moment when CH asked me if I wanted a subscription for THM or HTB to help make the Discord server cooler. I felt really happy that he asked me. I told him I was doing it because I loved the community, but he still wanted to offer it to me. I mentioned that I would collect it once I mastered the fundamentals.

- Overall, it was a good day 😊

## 💻 Career

- 🧠 I felt **Hack The Box: Junior Cybersecurity Analyst** learning path was time-consuming and a little bit hard, so,
- 🔐 I went with Try Hack Me, which was super fun and easy.
  - I went through **the Pre-security pathway**
  - And finished till **How the web works**
  - I had a lot of doubts about networking, which I cleared with my friend ChatGPT

## 🧍 Personal

- Good

## 💻 Career

- 📌 What I Studied

- Learned about **Nmap (Network Mapper)** → tool for network discovery & security auditing.  

  ### Key Scan Types  
  - **SYN Scan (-sS)** → stealthy & fast  
  - **TCP Connect (-sT)** → completes handshake, less stealthy  
  - **UDP Scan (-sU)** → finds UDP services  
  - **Version Detection (-sV)** & **OS Detection (-O)**  
  - **Aggressive Scan (-A)** → combines multiple scans  
  - **Port Scans (-p, -p-)** → specific, full, or fast scans  
  - **Host Discovery (-sn)** → ping sweep for live hosts  

  ### Other Notes  
  - Save scan results:  
    - `-oN` → normal output  
    - `-oX` → XML  
    - `-oG` → grepable

## 🧍 Personal  

- Great focus today, steady progress 🚀  

## 💻 Career  

- 📌 What I Studied  

- Learned about **Vulnerability Analysis** using Nmap & SearchSploit.  

  ### 🔎 Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)  
  - **auth** → test weak/default creds  
  - **malware** → detect trojans/worms  
  - **banner** → grab service banners (version info)  
  - **exploit** → test known exploits (⚠️ only in labs)  
  - **vuln** → CVE-based vulnerability detection  
  - **safe / intrusive** → non-intrusive vs. aggressive scans  

  ### 📂 SearchSploit (Exploit-DB)  
  - Update DB → `searchsploit -u`  
  - Search exploits → `searchsploit apache 2.4.49`  
  - Show exploit path → `searchsploit -p apache 2.4.49`  

  ### ✅ Vulnerability Analysis Workflow  
  1. Run Nmap scan → `nmap -sS -sV <target_ip>`  
  2. Use NSE scripts → check auth, malware, vuln, banner  
  3. Cross-check findings with SearchSploit  
  4. Verify manually → banners/versions may be misleading  
  5. Document findings (CVE ID, exploit path, risk level)  

  ### ⚡ Example Attack Chain  
  - Found **OpenSSH 7.2** with Nmap  
  - NSE confirmed weak login allowed  
  - SearchSploit revealed **CVE-2016-6210** exploit  
  - Validated in a controlled lab environment
